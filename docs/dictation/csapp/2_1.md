# 2.1 Information Storage

Rather than accessing individual bits in memory, most computers use blocks of
8 bits, or bytes, as the smallest addressable unit of memory. A machine-level
program views memory as a very large array of bytes, referred to as **virtual memory**. 
Every byte of memory is identified by a unique number, known as its
address, and the set of all possible addresses is known as the **virtual address space**.
As indicated by its name, this virtual address space is just a conceptual image
presented to the machine-level program. The actual implementation (presented
in Chapter 9) uses a combination of dynamic random access memory (DRAM),
flash memory, disk storage, special hardware, and operating system software to
provide the program with what appears to be a monolithic byte array.

In subsequent chapters, we will cover how the compiler and run-time system
partitions this memory space into more manageable units to store the different
program objects, that is, program data, instructions, and control information.
Various mechanisms are used to allocate and manage the storage for different
parts of the program. This management is all performed within the virtual address
space. For example, the value of a pointer in C—whether it points to an integer,
a structure, or some other program object—is the virtual address of the first byte
of some block of storage. The C compiler also associates type information with
each pointer, so that it can generate different machine-level code to access the
value stored at the location designated by the pointer depending on the type of
that value. Although the C compiler maintains this type information, the actual
machine-level program it generates has no information about data types. It simply
treats each program object as a block of bytes and the program itself as a sequence
of bytes.

## 2.1.1 Hexadecimal Notation

A single byte consists of 8 bits. In binary notation, its value ranges from 00000000<sub>2</sub>
to 11111111<sub>2</sub>. When viewed as a decimal integer, its value ranges from 0<sub>10</sub> to 255<sub>10</sub>.
Neither notation is very convenient for describing bit patterns. Binary notation
is too verbose, while with decimal notation it is tedious to convert to and from
bit patterns. Instead, we write bit patterns as base-16, or **hexadecimal** numbers.
Hexadecimal (or simply “hex”) uses digits ‘0’ through ‘9’ along with characters
‘A’ through ‘F’ to represent 16 possible values. Figure 2.2 shows the decimal and
binary values associated with the 16 hexadecimal digits. Written in hexadecimal,
the value of a single byte can range from 00<sub>16</sub> to FF<sub>16</sub>.

In C, numeric constants starting with `0x` or `0X` are interpreted as being in
hexadecimal. The characters ‘A’ through ‘F’ may be written in either upper- or
lowercase. For example, we could write the number FA1D37B<sub>16</sub> as `0xFA1D37B`, as
`0xfa1d37b`, or even mixing upper- and lowercase (e.g., `0xFa1D37b`). We will use
the C notation for representing hexadecimal values in this book.

A common task in working with machine-level programs is to manually convert between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal representations of bit patterns. Converting between binary and hexadecimal is straightforward, since it can be
performed one hexadecimal digit at a time. Digits can be converted by referring
to a chart such as that shown in Figure 2.2. One simple trick for doing the conversion in your head is to memorize the decimal equivalents of hex digits A, C, and F.The hex values B, D, and E can be translated to decimal by computing their values
relative to the first three.

|               |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |
| ------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Hex digit     | 0    | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6    | 7    |
| Decimal value | 0    | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6    | 7    |
| Binary value  | 0000 | 0001 | 0010 | 0011 | 0100 | 0101 | 0110 | 0111 |
| Hex digit     | 8    | 9    | A    | B    | C    | D    | E    | F    |
| Decimal value | 8    | 9    | 10   | 11   | 12   | 13   | 14   | 15   |
| Binary value  | 1000 | 1001 | 1010 | 1011 | 1100 | 1101 | 1110 | 1111 |

For example, suppose you are given the number 0x173A4C. You can convert
this to binary format by expanding each hexadecimal digit, as follows:

|             |      |      |      |      |      |      |
| ----------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Hexadecimal | 1    | 7    | 3    | A    | 4    | C    |
| Binary      | 0001 | 0111 | 0011 | 1010 | 0100 | 1100 |

This gives the binary representation 000101110011101001001100.

Conversely, given a binary number 1111001010110110110011, you convert it
to hexadecimal by first splitting it into groups of 4 bits each. Note, however, that if
the total number of bits is not a multiple of 4, you should make the leftmost group
be the one with fewer than 4 bits, effectively padding the number with leading
zeros. Then you translate each group of bits into the corresponding hexadecimal
digit:

|             |     |      |      |      |      |      |
| ----------- | --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Binary      | 11  | 1100 | 1010 | 1101 | 1011 | 0011 |
| Hexadecimal | 3   | C    | A    | D    | B    | 3    |
